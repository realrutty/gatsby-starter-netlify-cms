This is where I write some words about things that are important to me.

## I like band

Yes, I like band. That is a H2 above, stating that fact. I wonder if I could insert another image below this text?

![Coffee](/img/blog-index.jpg "I like coffee, oh yes")

More words here? Yes, I can keep writing

I can write lists. Here are my favourite coffees:

* black
* strong and black
* black and strong

OK, this is a little weird to type compared to WordPress. I'll get used to it\

How about a quote?

> This is a quote about how much I like band and coffee

OK
